# Join the Peng Lab
<br>

We are always eager to connect with enthusiastic and curious individuals who are passionate about science. Whether you are an experienced researcher or just starting your journey, we encourage you to reach out and share your interests, background, and goals. Our lab values collaboration, creativity, and diversity, and we are committed to providing a supportive environment where you can grow your skills and explore new ideas. If you are interested in joining our team or simply learning more about our work, please don’t hesitate to contact us — we would be delighted to hear from you.


## Graduate Students

At Indiana University School of Medicine, students can apply to a single [graduate program](https://medicine.iu.edu/graduate-degrees). 

Once students are admitted to Indiana University School of Medicine, during the first year of a Ph.D. program, students rotate through ~3 labs prior to deciding on a thesis lab. Our lab is usually open for rotation students every quarter and will generally have room for 1-2 new graduate students (regardless of program affiliation) per year.

As the 3rd rotation period comes to a close, we will talk with the year's rotation students (at least those who remain interested!) about joining the lab.  During this period, we encourage students to keep talking to the PI and lab members about what kind of project they might want to shape. We consider project fit, scientific chemistry, and alignment with lab values. Because we are a member of multiple graduate programs with different policies and timings for final lab decision making, we cannot make any final commitments until the end of the Spring Quarter to ensure all rotations students are given consideration.

## Postdoctoral Fellows

Inquiries about Postdoctoral positions should be emailed directly to <b>Dr. Gang Peng</b>


## Other Visitors

Our lab warmly welcomes a variety of visitors, including high school students, undergraduates, master’s students, and researchers on sabbatical or internships from academia or industry. We are happy to explore flexible arrangements to provide valuable research experiences for motivated individuals. While we strive to ensure fair compensation through your home institution or our lab, we are always open to discussing opportunities to learn, contribute, and engage with our team.
